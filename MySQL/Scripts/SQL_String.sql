-- MySQL CONCAT function
SELECT CONCAT('MySQL',' ','CONCAT');

-- If you add a NULL value, the CONCAT function returns a NULL value as follows:
SELECT CONCAT('MySQL',NULL,'CONCAT');

-- To get the full names of contacts, you use the CONCAT function to concatenate first name, space, last name as the following statement:
SELECT 
    concat(contactFirstName,' ',contactLastName) Fullname
FROM
    customers;
    
-- MySQL provides a special form of the CONCAT function: CONCAT_WS function. The CONCAT_WS function concatenates two or more string values with a predefined separator.
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',','John','Doe');

-- The CONCAT_WS function returns NULL if and only if the first argument, which is the separator, is NULL. See the following example:
SELECT CONCAT_WS(NULL ,'Jonathan', 'Smith');

-- Unlike the CONCAT function, the CONCAT_WS function skips NULL values after the separator argument. In other words, it ignores NULL values.
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',','Jonathan', 'Smith',NULL);

-- The following statement constructs complete addresses using the CONCAT_WS function.
SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(CHAR(13),
            CONCAT_WS(' ', contactLastname, contactFirstname),
            addressLine1,
            addressLine2,
            ' ',
            CONCAT_WS(' ', postalCode, city),
            country,
            CONCAT_WS(CHAR(13), '')) AS Customer_Address
FROM
    customers;

SELECT contactLastname, contactFirstname,addressLine1,addressLine2,postalCode,city FROM customers

-- INSTR Keyword
-- The INSTR function returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. If the substring is not found in the str, the INSTR function returns zero (0).
-- The INSTR function accepts two arguments:
-- The str is the string that you want to search in.
-- The substr is the substring that you want to search for.
-- The INSTR function is not case sensitive. It means that it does not matter if you pass the lowercase, uppercase, title case, etc., the results are always the same.
-- If you want the INSTR function to perform searches in case-sensitive manner on a non-binary string, you use the BINARY operator to cast a one the argument of the INSTR function from a non-binary string to a binary string.

select INSTR('MySQL INSTR', 'MySQL');

-- The following statement returns the same result because the INSTR function is case-insensitive.

SELECT INSTR('MySQL INSTR', 'mysql');

-- To force INSTR function to search based on case-sensitive fashion, you use the BINARY operator as follows:

SELECT INSTR('MySQL INSTR', BINARY 'mysql');

-- Suppose you want to find product whose name contains the car keyword, you can use the INSTR function as follows:

SELECT 
    productName
FROM
    products
WHERE
    INSTR(productname,'Car') > 0;

-- With Like Keyword
SELECT 
    productname
FROM
    products
WHERE
    productname LIKE '%Car%';

-- Both queries return the same result. So which one is faster, the INSTR or the LIKE operator?
-- The answer is the that they are the same. They are both case-sensitive and perform full table scans.
-- Letâ€™s create an index on the productname column
CREATE INDEX idx_products_name ON products(productname);

SELECT 
    productname
FROM
    products
WHERE
    productname LIKE '1900%';
    
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    productname
FROM
    products
WHERE
    productname LIKE '1900%';

EXPLAIN SELECT 
    productname
FROM
    products
WHERE
    instr(productname,'1900');

-- The INSTR function performs a table scan even though the productname column has an index. 
-- This is because MySQL cannot make any assumption about the semantics of the INSTR function, whereby MySQL can utilize its understanding of the semantics of the LIKE operator.
