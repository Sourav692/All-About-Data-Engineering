# All About Data Engineering

This is like a continuous repo where I will add details related to different most used Data Engineering Tools. The repo consist of all the study topics I have completed  and also different usecases I have faced/done in my tenure as big data engineering till now.

Below are the Data Engineering tools that would be covered as part of this repo:

| Topics                      | Current Status |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| HDFS                        | To Do          |
| Hive                        | In Progress    |
| Impala                      | To Do          |
| Sqoop                       | To Do          |
| Oozie                       | To Do          |
| Spark-Scala                 | To Do          |
| Pyspark                     | In Progress    |
| Spark Streaming with Python | In Progress    |
| Spark Streaming with Scala  | To Do          |
| MySQL                       | In Progress    |
| Airflow                     | To Do          |

| Apache Beam                 | To Do          |

Below are some of the topics of each tools would be covered in this repo:

* Documents related to overview on different Data Engineering tools.
* Coding examples.
* Frequently asked coding examples in interviews.
* Document related to different practical use cases on Data Engineering tools.
* Different Research Papers.

Aim for this repo is to make an all-in-one study guide to make you an **AWESOME DATA ENGINEER**  and help you all to crack interview related to Data Engineering.
